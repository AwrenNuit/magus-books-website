            <h1>Massage with Mela</h1>
            <p class="content-bold">What is Integrative Intuitive Massage?</p>
            <p style="margin-top:-10px;">
              This Massage, with Mela the Master Massage Therapist, begins
              with communication between the giver and receiver about where
              greater relief and ease is wanted within the body. Mela allows
              the receiver to disrobe privately and relax on a heated table,
              before she enters the healing space. You are offered the choice
              of incorporating Chakra-tuning aromatherapy as we begin the
              actual session. Mela tunes into your body at your head or
              your feet, and then goes where she is called to by the body.
              Sometimes deep pressure is needed, sometimes a light unwinding
              is what the body is wanting. Profound relaxation and trance-like
              states are frequent results following this type of healing
              session with Mela.
            </p>
            <p class="content-bold">What is Cranio-Sacral Shiatsu?</p>
            <p style="margin-top:-10px;">
              This particular treatment can help unwind and encourages
              expansion into YourSelf. Traditionally performed through loose,
              comfortable clothing (though recipient may disrobe if they
              wish), Mela takes time to listen to the body, finding the
              cranial wave and then assisting to unwind blockages and help
              create a free flow of energetic wellness within. It is not
              uncommon for the recipient to experience visuals and releasing
              of emotions or energies, and to feel more Free &amp; Lighter
              within their bodies.

            <h1>Herbalism with Liz</h1>
            <p>
              Herbalism is an both ancient and a modern healing art exploring
              the inner secrets of herbs and how they work with the body to
              enhance health.
            </p>
            <p>
              All around the world herbalism has been practiced for millennia.
              Many healing traditions have collected empirical knowledge about
              herbal healing for untold centuries. Studying these traditions
              and bringing ancient knowledge from around the world together
              into one practice as been a life long process for me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Herbalism is also a modern healing art exploring the inner
              secrets of herbs and how they react to the body and with
              medications. Using scientific studies to enhance the traditional
              knowledge of herbalism and using the theoretical models of herb
              to drug interaction results in a more cautious and safe approach
              to herbalism.
            </p>
            <p>
              Blending knowledge from healing traditions and modern research
              is the heart of my practice—Medicinal Herbalism.

            <h1>Flower Essences with Clare</h1>
            <p>
              Flower essences focus on rebalancing the mind and can support relief 
              from trauma, PTSD, fear, phobias, poor concentration, family issues, 
              grief, anger management, stress, anxiety, panic attacks, depression 
              and more. They can aid in the rebalancing of physical issues, too, 
              as our emotions affect us physically through the body-mind relationship. 
              Overall, they help create awareness about and resolve issues of 
              unhealthy conditioned habits or perceptions. This relearning and 
              rebalancing can lead to greater well-being and harmony in our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clare has studied flower essence therapy with Martin Bulgerin in 
              Minneapolis and the Flower Essence Society in California and herbalism 
              with Lise Wolff, Liz Johnson and Matthew Wood. Her focus at Magus Books 
              is flower essence therapy with herbal tinctures as additional support. 
              Clare is passionate about helping to relieve both mental and physical 
              pain. During a session, she will gather as full a picture of you as 
              possible so that your needs can be matched with the plants that will 
              support you in your journey to restoration.
