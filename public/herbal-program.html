          <h2 class="centerText">About The Magus Herbal Program</h2>
          <p class="leftText">
            The Magus Herbal Program was created to address the desire in the Twin
            Cities for a comprehensive education in herbal medicine. Liz Johnson
            began teaching in the year 2000 when a group of former clients came to
            her asking for weekly classes. Based extensively in Western Herbalism,
            Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Aurvadyic Medicine, Liz established
            what is now known as The Magus Herbal Program.<br />
            <br />
            The current program involves three years worth of classes (including a
            summer breaks), and a final case study. Non-invasive diagnosis
            techniques are taught, studied, and practiced throughout the program and
            the herbs associated with each diagnosis are extensively covered.
            Students will be exposed to a multitude of herbs in every class and
            learn everything from their historical uses and lore, to their modern
            use in herbal medicine, including the phytochemistry and prescription
            drug reactions. If this sound overwhelming, don’t worry. There are many
            resources The Magus Herbal Program (MHP) has to address your personal
            learning styles.<br />
            <br />
            Most recently, an online learning center has been added to the MHP. This
            digital content provides a space for additional learning through the use
            of case studies, articles, interactive modules, and student run forums.
            Students are encouraged to record lectures as well.
          </p>

          <h2 class="centerText">What Students Will Learn</h2>
          <p class="leftText">
            Students will learn extensive human anatomy and physiology, non-invasive
            diagnostic methods, herbal medicine traditions, and of course everything
            could possibly want to know about herbs. Anatomy, Physiology, and tissue
            states (i.e. the condition a tissue or organ is in) are taught alongside
            the herbal content to ensure you, as the student and future herbalist,
            will have a well rounded education in how specific herbs address
            different tissues and aliments. Each herb’s history, lore, and
            chemistry, are covered in a number of contexts. Combining both the
            understanding of the body and the herbs, classes specifically in the
            creation of herbal remedies are a core part of the Magus Herbal Program.
            As part of these classes, students will be able to practice making the
            preparations and remedies, have access of a growing library of recipes,
            and bring home a remedy they create in class.<br />
            <br />
            All these components are taught over the course of three years, each
            year adding to the content that was taught in the previous year. In the
            third year, students will be expected to create a case study in which
            they accurately diagnosis a client, create a formula for treatment, and
            document the results. A final fourth year of an internship is possible
            should a student complete all the tests and show a willingness and
            desire to make themselves a professional herbalist.<br />
            <br />
            Students will have access to digital learning content to reinforce what
            is learned in class. Class notes, glossaries, interactive diagrams,
            knowledge checks, discussion forums, additional resources, and links to
            articles are all available through the online portal. Knowledge checks
            for each class are available for students looking to test themselves.
            However, they are not mandatory. Each year had an optional final
            assessment should the student wish to test themselves.<br />
            <br />
            he Magus Herbal Program becomes the central hub to gain and share
            information on all things herbal medicine.

          <h2 class="centerText">About Accreditation</h2>
          <p class="leftText">
            While there is no state or federal approved licensure for herbal
            medicine practitioners, there are several organizations across the
            country that recognize the study of herbs and their uses. The largest of
            these is the American Herbalist Guild. They and several other
            organizations like the National Association of Nurses for Aromatherapy,
            have programs that recognize herbal schools and other holistic education
            programs. The Magus Herbal Program is currently looking at our
            programming and course work to see if these various organizations
            requirements align with our content. This is a long and difficult
            process.<br />
            <br />
            “An accredited herbal school does not necessarily guarantee a better
            herbal education than a non-accredited school, nor do its graduate
            necessarily have professional advantages.”<br />
            -American Herbalist Guild Guide to Getting an Herbal Education
          </p>

          <h2 class="centerText">Tuition and Pricing</h2>
          <p class="leftText">
            Herbal programs can cost upward of $4,000 per semester depending on the
            university. Even online programs can reach as much as $9,000 for a
            single year of classes. The Magus Herbal Program offers the same tools
            of traditional programs with the small class feel and benefits. Our
            online resources add the advantage of always having class notes,
            diagrams, glossaries, material medica, recipes, and so much at your
            finger tips. All of this content for a single year of the MHP costs less
            than a grand.<br />
            <br />
            The standard cost is $20 to $30 per class. However, students who sign up
            for the whole program receive a $240.00 per year discount. Students are
            able to make payments throughout the year as well. Contact

                    Herbalism is both an ancient and a modern healing art exploring
                    the inner secrets of herbs and how they work with the body to
                    enhance health.<br />
                    <br />
                    All around the world herbalism has been practiced for millennia.
                    Many healing traditions have collected empirical knowledge about
                    herbal healing for untold centuries. Studying these traditions
                    and bringing ancient knowledge from around the world together
                    into one practice as been a lifelong process for me. Herbalism
                    is also a modern healing art exploring the inner secrets of
                    herbs and how they react to the body and with medications. Using
                    scientific studies to enhance the traditional knowledge of
                    herbalism and using the theoretical models of herb to drug
                    interaction results in a more cautious and safe approach to
                    herbalism.<br />
                    <br />
                    Blending knowledge from healing traditions and modern research
                    is the heart of my practice—Medicinal Herbalism.

                    Markus Ironwood is the manager of the Magus Arcane Academy. With
                    a master’s degree in education and over 15 years of occult,
                    witchcraft, botany, and herbalism experience, he will forever
                    continue to study and explore the esoteric and scientific.
                    Markus is most interested in the intersection between social
                    justice, ecology, and the experience of embodiment. As the
                    Academy Manager, he coordinates and schedules classes, creates
                    programming and training manuals, and manages the online
                    components of the Academy, including content for the Magus
                    Herbal Program. When not running the Academy, teaching his own
                    classes on astrology and mythology, planning events, and
                    generally raising hell at Magus Books and Herbs, he likes
                    camping along the north shore, watching RuPaul’s drag race, and
                    hitting the gym several times a week.
